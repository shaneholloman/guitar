`guita╭`, distributed as `guitar`, is a Rust terminal UI for working with Git history from a topology-first point of view. It is built with `ratatui`, `crossterm`, and `libgit2`, and is designed for exploring, filtering, and operating on large repositories without leaving the terminal.

## Status And Warning

This is a hobby project with sharp Git tools. It can stage, unstage, commit, force checkout, force push, delete branches, reset, stash, pop, drop, rebase, merge, cherry-pick, prune worktrees, and discard file changes.

Use it carefully on important repositories. Keep backups, understand what the selected row and focused pane mean before using action mode, and report issues when behavior is surprising.

## Demo

Older recording of the `v0.1.12` feature set:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oERA8MYlHjQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oERA8MYlHjQ)

The recording is still useful as a tour. This README and the in-app settings/help view are the current source of truth for shortcuts and behavior.

## Requirements

- Rust and Cargo when building from source.
- A non-bare Git repository. Bare repositories are not supported by the UI.
- `user.name` and `user.email` configured in Git before opening a repository. `guitar` reads these on repository load and uses them when creating commits.
- Terminal mouse support for pane dragging and wheel scrolling.
- SSH or HTTPS credentials for private remotes when using network operations.

Set identity globally:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

Or set identity per repository:

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "you@example.com"
```

## Install

Prebuilt binaries are published on the releases page:

[https://github.com/asinglebit/guitar/releases](https://github.com/asinglebit/guitar/releases)

Build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asinglebit/guitar.git
cd guitar
cargo build --release
```

The release binary is written to:

```bash
target/release/guitar
```

## Run

Run from inside a repository, a repository subdirectory, or with an explicit path:

```bash
guitar
guitar ../path/to/repository
```

The first non-flag argument is treated as the repository path. If no path is provided, `.` is used. The path is canonicalized and then resolved to the Git repository root when possible.

Meta flags:

```bash
guitar --version
guitar -v
guitar --reset
```

`--version` and `-v` print the version and exit. `--reset` deletes the saved `guitar` config directory, then starts the app with regenerated defaults.

If the path cannot be opened as a Git repository, `guitar` falls back to the splash screen and shows saved recent repositories.

## Mental Model

`guitar` is built around a few core ideas:

- The graph is the primary view. Commits, refs, stashes, worktrees, and optional HEAD reflog entries are projected onto one topology-oriented list.
- Row `0` is a synthetic uncommitted-work row above `HEAD`. It represents staged files, unstaged files, and conflicts in the working tree.
- Commit history loads incrementally on a background worker. The app becomes usable while more history is still being walked.
- Focus controls what keys operate on. The same key can scroll the graph, a side pane, a status pane, settings, a modal, or the file viewer depending on focus.
- Scope navigation is horizontal: `h` widens outward, `l` narrows inward.
- Dangerous commands are gated behind action mode. By default, press `Ctrl+a`, then the action key.

## Interface Sections

### Splash

The splash screen appears when no repository is open or when you back out of the graph. It lists recent repositories from `recent.json`.

- `Enter` or `l` opens the selected recent repository.
- `Esc` returns to the graph when a repository is already loaded.
- `q` exits.

### Graph

The graph is the central history view. It can render:

- The synthetic uncommitted-work row.
- Commits in topology order.
- Local and remote branch labels.
- Lightweight and annotated tags resolved to commits.
- Stash commits placed near their base commits.
- Worktree badges for commits checked out in main or linked worktrees.
- Optional HEAD reflog labels and roots.
- Optional abbreviated SHA column.

Graph row details are loaded by window, so large repositories can stay responsive.

### Branches

The branch pane lists local branches first and remote branches after them, sorted by name inside each group.

- Filled circle: visible local branch.
- Hollow circle: hidden local branch.
- Filled diamond: visible remote branch.
- Hollow diamond: hidden remote branch.

Branch visibility affects graph roots and filtering. An empty visibility set means all branches are visible.

### Tags

The tag pane lists local tags sorted by name. Tags are shown in the graph at the commit they resolve to. The app can create and delete local lightweight tags.

### Stashes

The stash pane lists stash commits. Stashes are real commits and are rendered in the graph near their first parent.

### Reflogs

The reflog pane lists recent HEAD reflog entries. Reflog rows can jump to commits that are visible in the graph. If the reflog commit is hidden, enable graph reflogs with `9` so the walker includes HEAD reflog roots.

### Worktrees

The worktree pane lists the main worktree and linked worktrees.

Rows include:

- Worktree name.
- Branch name, detached HEAD short SHA, or no-head state.
- Current-worktree marker.
- Dirty marker.
- Locked marker.
- Invalid marker.

Valid worktrees can be opened from the pane. Linked worktrees can be locked, unlocked, removed, or pruned through the worktree actions.

### Status

The status area is on the right.

On the uncommitted row:

- The top status pane shows conflicts and staged changes.
- The bottom status pane shows conflicts and unstaged changes.
- Conflicts appear in both panes and are highlighted.

On a commit row:

- The top status pane shows files changed by the selected commit compared with its first parent.
- The bottom status pane is not used.

Status symbols:

- `!` conflict.
- `~` modified.
- `+` added.
- `-` deleted.
- `→` renamed.

### Inspector

The inspector shows selected commit metadata:

- Commit SHA.
- Parent SHAs.
- Featured branch labels.
- Author.
- Committer.
- Summary.
- Body.

When the selected row is uncommitted, the inspector appears if there are conflicts.

### Viewer

The viewer opens from a selected status row. It can show:

- Working tree file contents and diff for the uncommitted row.
- Commit file contents and diff for selected commits.
- Conflict files with conflict-marker highlighting.
- Unified diff style.
- Hunk-only mode.
- Side-by-side split diff mode.
- Line numbers.
- Wrapped long lines.

For merge commits, file lists and file diffs compare against the first parent.

### Settings

The settings/help view is opened with `?`. It shows version, commit heatmap, config paths, Git identity, auth notes, theme choices, and active keymaps. Theme rows and keybinding rows are selectable.

## Navigation

### Scope

`h` and `l` are the most important navigation keys.

- In the graph, `l` narrows into details. On a commit row it focuses the inspector; on the uncommitted row it focuses staged or unstaged status.
- In the inspector, `l` moves to status.
- In status, `l` opens the selected file in the viewer.
- In the viewer, `h` returns to status.
- In status, `h` moves outward to inspector or graph.
- In the graph, `h` opens/focuses the branch pane.
- In branch, tag, stash, reflog, and worktree panes, `l` jumps into the selected item.
- In settings, `h` returns to the graph.
- In the splash screen, `l` opens the selected recent repository.

### Focus

`Tab` and `Ctrl+n` move to the next focusable pane. `Shift+Tab` and `Ctrl+p` move to the previous focusable pane.

Focusable panes are ordered:

```text
graph/viewer, inspector, staged/commit status, unstaged status, worktrees, reflogs, stashes, tags, branches
```

Hidden panes are skipped. The unstaged status pane is focusable only on the uncommitted row.

### Selection

`Enter` means "open/select" for the current focus:

- Splash: open selected recent repository.
- Settings theme: activate and save theme.
- Settings keybinding: open key capture.
- Graph: open a worktree badge if the selected commit has valid worktree candidates.
- Branch/tag/stash/reflog panes: jump to the corresponding graph row.
- Worktree pane: open the selected valid worktree.
- Status panes: open the selected file in the viewer.
- Choice modals: confirm the selected row.

### Back

`Esc` cancels modals or widens back to the graph.

- From graph: opens the splash screen when the history worker is idle.
- From splash: returns to graph when a repository is loaded.
- From viewer/settings/side panes/status/inspector: returns to graph.
- From text-entry modals: clears input and returns to the relevant view.
- From auth prompt: cancels the pending network operation.

### Scrolling

All scroll commands act on the focused pane or viewport:

- `j` / `Down`: one row down.
- `k` / `Up`: one row up.
- `Ctrl+d`: half page down.
- `Ctrl+u`: half page up.
- `PageDown`: page down.
- `PageUp`: page up.
- `Ctrl+Alt+d`: jump halfway toward the end of the focused graph/side pane list.
- `Ctrl+Alt+u`: jump halfway toward the beginning of the focused graph/side pane list.
- `g` / `Home`: beginning.
- `Shift+G` / `End`: end.

In full viewer mode, `Ctrl+d` and `Ctrl+u` jump between diff hunk edges. In hunk and split viewer modes, they scroll by half pages.

### Graph Jumps

- `{`: jump to the previous visible branch-bearing commit.
- `}`: jump to the next visible branch-bearing commit.
- `[`: jump to the first loaded child of the selected commit.
- `]`: jump to the first parent of the selected commit.
- `/`: open SHA-prefix lookup for loaded history.

SHA lookup accepts non-empty prefixes up to 40 characters. It searches commits already known to the worker.

### Mouse

Mouse capture is enabled while the app runs.

- Mouse wheel scrolls the pane under the cursor and focuses it.
- Drag the left and right vertical dividers to resize side panes.
- Drag stacked pane dividers to resize branch/tag/stash/reflog/worktree, inspector/status, and staged/unstaged splits.
- Drag the split-diff divider to resize side-by-side viewer columns.
- Layout changes from dragging are saved when the mouse button is released.

## Inputs And Keymaps

### Input Modes

There are two keymap modes:

- Normal mode: navigation, layout, safe operations, and non-destructive creation prompts.
- Action mode: single-shot mode for dangerous or destructive operations.

By default, `Ctrl+a` enters action mode. The next handled key runs through the action keymap and then the mode returns to normal.

Action mode inherits normal-mode navigation and safe operations, but overrides or adds the dangerous bindings listed below. Notably, action-mode `r` is rebase and action-mode `m` is merge.

### Text Inputs

Text prompts are single-line inputs.

Supported editing keys:

- Printable character keys insert text.
- `Backspace` removes before the cursor.
- `Delete` removes at the cursor.
- `Left` and `Right` move the cursor.
- `Home` and `End` jump to the start or end.
- `Enter` submits when the prompt accepts the current value.
- `Esc` cancels.

Text prompts are used for commit messages, cherry-pick messages, branch names, tag names, worktree names, worktree paths, worktree lock reasons, SHA lookup, and auth fields.

### Auth Inputs

The auth modal uses:

- `Tab`, `Shift+Tab`, `Up`, or `Down` to switch between username and secret fields for HTTP/HTTPS prompts.
- `Enter` to submit.
- `Esc` to cancel the network operation.

For SSH passphrase prompts, focus stays on the secret field.

### Key Capture

In settings, selecting a keybinding opens key capture.

- Press a new key combination to preview it.
- `Enter` confirms if there is no conflict.
- `Ctrl+C` cancels.

If a normal-mode binding is also present in action mode for the same command, rebinding the normal key syncs the matching action-mode binding.

## Git Operations

Operations depend on the focused pane and selected row. Most operations call `reload` on success so the graph, status, panes, and recent path state refresh.

### Stage

Normal key: `s`.

- Graph focus on the uncommitted row stages all unstaged changes, including untracked files and deletes.
- Status bottom focus stages the selected unstaged file.
- Conflict rows cannot be staged from the UI. Resolve conflicts externally, then continue the active operation.

Ignored files are not staged.

### Unstage

Normal key: `u`.

- Graph focus on the uncommitted row unstages all staged files with a mixed reset to `HEAD`.
- Status top focus unstages the selected staged file.
- In a repository without `HEAD`, unstaging a file removes it from the initial index.
- Conflict rows cannot be unstaged from the UI.

### Commit

Normal key: `c`.

`Commit` opens a single-line commit message prompt when staged changes exist. The commit uses the configured `user.name` and `user.email`. If the branch is unborn, the commit becomes the root commit.

### Fetch

Normal key: `f`.

Fetch runs as a background network operation against `origin`.

It fetches:

- `refs/heads/*` into `refs/remotes/origin/*`.
- `refs/tags/*` into local tags.

Pruning is enabled.

### Checkout

Action key: `Ctrl+a`, then `o`.

Checkout is forceful and uses libgit2 checkout options with conflicts allowed.

- Branch pane focus checks out the selected branch.
- If the selected branch is local, it is checked out directly.
- If the selected branch is remote, `guitar` materializes a local branch using the remote branch's short name, sets upstream to the remote branch, and checks it out.
- Graph focus checks out the selected commit.
- If the commit has no branch label, graph checkout uses detached HEAD.
- If the commit has one branch label, that branch is checked out.
- If the commit has multiple branch labels, a checkout modal lets you choose.

The uncommitted row cannot be checked out.

### Branch Visibility

Normal keys:

- `Shift+T`: toggle selected branch visibility.
- `Space`: solo selected branch.

Branch visibility filters graph roots and branch labels.

- From branch pane focus, the action applies to the selected branch.
- From graph focus, the action applies to branch labels on the selected commit.
- If multiple branch labels are present, a modal lets you choose.
- When no branches are hidden, toggling one branch creates an explicit "all except this branch" visibility set.
- If filtering would hide every branch, the filter resets to all visible.

### Create Branch

Normal key: `b`.

- Graph focus creates a local branch at the selected commit.
- Reflog focus creates a local branch at the selected reflog entry's new commit.
- Branch creation does not check out the new branch.
- The selected uncommitted row is not a branch target.

### Delete Branch

Action key: `Ctrl+a`, then `Shift+D`.

- Branch pane focus deletes the selected branch.
- Graph focus deletes a branch label attached to the selected commit.
- If multiple deletable labels exist, a modal lets you choose.
- The current branch cannot be deleted.
- Local branch deletion removes the local branch ref.
- Remote branch deletion pushes an empty source refspec to the selected remote branch.

Remote deletion derives the remote from the branch name. For example, `origin/topic` deletes `topic` from `origin`.

### Tags

Create tag: normal key `t`.

Delete tag: action key `Ctrl+a`, then `Shift+U`.

- Tag creation creates a lightweight local tag at the selected commit.
- If the graph is on the uncommitted row, tag creation targets the first real commit.
- Tag deletion from the tag pane deletes the selected local tag.
- Tag deletion from the graph deletes a tag attached to the selected commit. If multiple tags exist, a modal lets you choose.
- `guitar` can push local tags, but it does not delete remote tags.

### Push

Force push current branch: action key `Ctrl+a`, then `Shift+P`.

Push tags: action key `Ctrl+a`, then `Shift+V`.

- Branch push targets `origin`.
- Branch push is force push only and updates the current local branch on the remote branch with the same name.
- Detached HEAD cannot be pushed.
- Tag push pushes all local tags to `origin`.
- If no local tags exist, push-tags succeeds without changing anything.

### Stash

Stash current work: action key `Ctrl+a`, then `Shift+S`.

Pop selected stash: action key `Ctrl+a`, then `p`.

Drop selected stash: action key `Ctrl+a`, then `x`.

- Stash includes untracked files.
- Stash messages are generated from the current `HEAD` short SHA and summary.
- Pop applies the stash and drops it.
- Drop removes the stash without applying it.
- Pop/drop operate only when graph focus is on a stash row.

### Reset

Hard reset selected commit: action key `Ctrl+a`, then `Shift+H`.

Mixed reset selected commit: action key `Ctrl+a`, then `Shift+M`.

Discard selected status file: focus a status row and use action key `Ctrl+a`, then `Shift+H`.

- Graph hard reset moves the current branch or detached `HEAD` to the selected commit and rewrites index and working tree.
- Graph mixed reset moves the current branch or detached `HEAD` to the selected commit and rewrites the index while leaving working tree contents.
- File hard reset removes staged and working tree changes for the selected path by restoring it from `HEAD`.

### Cherry-pick

Action key: `Ctrl+a`, then `y`.

- Graph focus on a commit opens a single-line message prompt.
- The default message is `cherrypicked: <selected summary>`.
- The working tree must be clean before starting.
- If there are no conflicts, `guitar` commits immediately with the provided message.
- If conflicts occur, `guitar` stops and shows a conflict modal.
- Resolve files externally, then continue with `Ctrl+a`, `Shift+C`.
- Abort with `Ctrl+a`, `Shift+A`.

During an in-progress conflicted cherry-pick, the message is stored at `.git/GUITAR_CHERRYPICK_MSG` and removed on commit or abort.

### Rebase

Action key: `Ctrl+a`, then `r`.

- Rebases the current local branch onto the selected graph commit.
- Detached HEAD cannot be rebased.
- The selected commit cannot already be `HEAD`.
- The working tree must be clean before starting.
- Commits are driven through libgit2's rebase API.
- If conflicts occur, resolve files externally, then continue with `Ctrl+a`, `Shift+C`.
- Abort with `Ctrl+a`, `Shift+A`.

If a rebase, cherry-pick, or merge is already in progress, pressing the rebase action attempts to continue the active operation.

### Merge

Action key: `Ctrl+a`, then `m`.

- Merges the selected graph commit into the current local branch.
- Detached HEAD cannot be merged into.
- Another in-progress Git operation blocks merge start.
- The working tree must be clean before starting.
- Merge analysis honors Git's fast-forward preferences, including `merge.ff=only`.
- Fast-forward, up-to-date, normal merge commit, conflict, and abort states are surfaced in the UI.
- Continue with `Ctrl+a`, `Shift+C`.
- Abort with `Ctrl+a`, `Shift+A`.

If a rebase, cherry-pick, or merge is already in progress, pressing the merge action attempts to continue the active operation.

### Continue And Abort

Continue active operation: action key `Ctrl+a`, then `Shift+C`.

Abort active operation: action key `Ctrl+a`, then `Shift+A`.

These apply to active rebase, cherry-pick, or merge states.

On continue, `guitar` checks the index for conflicts. For conflicted paths, it inspects the worktree file:

- If the file still contains conflict markers, it remains conflicted.
- If the file exists and conflict markers are gone, it is added to the index.
- If the file was removed, it is removed from the index.

Then the active Git operation continues.

### Worktrees

Create worktree: normal key `w`.

Remove worktree: action key `Ctrl+a`, then `Shift+W`.

Lock or unlock worktree: action key `Ctrl+a`, then `Shift+L`.

Open worktree: focus a worktree row and press `Enter`; or press `Enter` on a graph worktree badge.

Create worktree flow:

1. Focus the graph on a real commit.
2. Press `w`.
3. Enter a worktree name.
4. Confirm or edit the default path.

The worktree name becomes a new local branch name. Names cannot be empty, `.`, `..`, or contain path separators. If worktree creation fails after branch creation, `guitar` attempts to delete the branch it created.

Default worktree paths are based on the current repository path:

```text
<repo-parent>/<repo-name>-<worktree-name>
```

Removal rules:

- Only linked worktrees can be removed.
- The current worktree cannot be removed.
- The main worktree cannot be removed.
- Locked worktrees cannot be removed.
- Valid worktrees are pruned with working-tree removal enabled.

Locking rules:

- Only valid linked worktrees can be locked.
- Locking opens a reason prompt. Empty reasons are allowed and become no reason.
- Locked linked worktrees can be unlocked with the same action.

Opening a worktree reloads the app at the selected worktree path.

## Authentication

Network auth is used for fetch, push current branch, push tags, and remote branch deletion.

### SSH

For SSH remotes, `guitar` tries:

1. Username from the URL or callback, falling back to `git`.
2. `ssh-agent` via libgit2.
3. A default private key without passphrase.
4. An in-app passphrase prompt if a default private key exists.

Default private key search order:

```text
~/.ssh/id_ed25519
~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

If no `ssh-agent` credential works and none of those keys exist, the operation fails with an SSH auth error.

### HTTP And HTTPS

For HTTP/HTTPS remotes, `guitar` tries:

1. Any matching secret already entered during the current `guitar` session.
2. Git credential helper through libgit2.
3. Username callback if requested by libgit2.
4. In-app username/password or username/token prompt.

Use a personal access token as the password when your hosting provider requires token auth.

### Auth Attempts And Secret Storage

- A network operation allows up to 3 auth prompt attempts.
- Rejected in-memory secrets are evicted before retry.
- Prompted secrets are stored only in memory for the running process.
- No prompted SSH passphrases, HTTPS passwords, or HTTPS tokens are written to `guitar` config files.
- Existing Git credential helpers may store credentials according to your Git configuration; that storage is outside `guitar`.

Only one network operation can run at a time.

## Settings

Open settings with `?`.

The settings view includes:

- App version.
- Commit heatmap.
- Config file paths.
- Git `user.name` and `user.email`.
- Auth behavior notes.
- Theme list.
- Normal-mode shortcuts.
- Action-mode shortcuts that differ from normal mode.

Selectable rows:

- Theme rows: `Enter` activates and saves the selected theme.
- Keybinding rows: `Enter` opens key capture.

Settings reuses normal navigation. Use `j`/`k`, page keys, `g`, `Shift+G`, or mouse wheel to move. Use `h`, `Esc`, or `?` to return to the graph.

Available built-in themes:

```text
classic
ansi

## Persistence

Saved app files live under your platform config directory in a `guitar` folder.

Common examples:

```text
Linux:   ~/.config/guitar
macOS:   ~/Library/Application Support/guitar
Windows: %APPDATA%\guitar
```

The app writes:

- `keymap.json`: keyboard mappings.
- `layout.json`: pane visibility, widths, weights, SHA display, graph reflog setting, zen/minimal state.
- `theme.json`: active theme and all color slots.
- `recent.json`: recent repository paths.

The app may also temporarily write `.git/GUITAR_CHERRYPICK_MSG` inside a repository during a conflicted cherry-pick.

Not persisted by `guitar`:

- SSH key passphrases entered in the auth modal.
- HTTPS usernames, passwords, or tokens entered in the auth modal.
- Branch visibility filters. They are preserved across reloads during a session, but not written to config.
- Current selection, scroll positions, open modal state, or current viewport.

Reset all saved app config:

```bash
guitar --reset
```

## Configuration Files

### keymap.json

`keymap.json` has `normal` and `action` arrays.

Example entry:

```json
{
  "key": "Char(j)",
  "modifiers": [],
  "command": "ScrollDown"
}
```

Supported key strings include:

```text
Backspace
Enter
Left
Right
Up
Down
Home
End
PageUp
PageDown
Tab
BackTab
Delete
Insert
Null
Esc
CapsLock
ScrollLock
NumLock
PrintScreen
Pause
F(n)
Char(x)
```

Supported modifiers:

```text
Shift
Control
Ctrl
Alt
Command
Meta
```

Supported commands are the command names listed in the keymap tables, without spaces, for example `ToggleSplitDiffMode`, `CreateWorktree`, `ContinueOperation`, and `AbortOperation`.

When an old keymap is loaded, `guitar` attempts small migrations for newly added default bindings.

### layout.json

Default layout:

```json
{
  "is_shas": true,
  "is_minimal": false,
  "is_branches": true,
  "is_tags": false,
  "is_stashes": false,
  "is_reflogs": false,
  "is_graph_reflogs": false,
  "is_worktrees": false,
  "is_status": true,
  "is_inspector": true,
  "is_zen": false,
  "width_left_pane": 45,
  "width_right_pane": 46,
  "weight_branches": 100,
  "weight_tags": 100,
  "weight_stashes": 100,
  "weight_reflogs": 100,
  "weight_worktrees": 100,
  "weight_inspector": 100,
  "weight_status": 100,
  "weight_status_top": 100,
  "weight_status_bottom": 100,
  "weight_viewer_split_left": 100,
  "weight_viewer_split_right": 100
}
```

Width values are clamped to a minimum of 16 columns. The center pane keeps at least 20 columns when possible. Stacked pane weights and split viewer weights are normalized to at least `1`.

The graph reflog toggle requires a reload because it changes graph roots.

### theme.json

`theme.json` stores a label and full color map. Loading a known preset label without custom colors resolves to that preset. Unknown labels or color overrides become a custom theme.

Example:

```json
{
  "label": "solarized dark",
  "colors": {
    "red": "#dc322f",
    "green": "#859900",
    "blue": "#268bd2",
    "grey_950": "#002b36",
    "border": "#073642",
    "text": "#839496",
    "highlighted": "#93a1a1"
  }
}
```

Color values can be:

- Hex colors like `#268bd2`.
- Terminal color names such as `red`, `green`, `blue`, `gray`, `dark_gray`, `light_red`, `white`, or `reset`.
- Indexed terminal colors like `indexed:42` or `indexed_42`.

Color slots:

```text
red, pink, purple, durple, indigo, blue, cyan, teal, green, grass,
lime, yellow, amber, orange, grapefruit, brown, dark_red,
light_green_900, grey_50, grey_100, grey_200, grey_300, grey_400,
grey_500, grey_600, grey_700, grey_800, grey_900, grey_950,
border, text, highlighted
```

Malformed theme files fall back to `classic` and are rewritten.

### recent.json

`recent.json` is a JSON array of absolute repository root paths:

```json
[
  "/home/me/src/project-a",
  "/home/me/src/project-b"
]
```

Recent repositories are appended when a repository opens successfully. There is no in-app remove or reorder UI.

## Development

Build:

```bash
cargo build
cargo build --release
```

Run from source:

```bash
cargo run -- .
cargo run -- ../path/to/repository
```

Test:

```bash
cargo test
```

Format:

```bash
cargo fmt
```

The value printed by `guitar --version` comes from Cargo package metadata. Release builds can override it at compile time with `GUITAR_BUILD_OVERWRITE_VERSION`.

Important source areas:

- `src/main.rs`: CLI flags and app startup.
- `src/app/app.rs`: main app state, event loop, draw orchestration, reload, graph worker sync.
- `src/app/input/`: keyboard, mouse, modal, navigation, Git, and worktree input handlers.
- `src/app/draw/`: TUI drawing for graph, panes, viewer, settings, status, and modals.
- `src/core/`: graph worker, walker, topology buffer, pane data, render helpers.
- `src/git/actions/`: mutating Git operations.
- `src/git/queries/`: repository reads, diffs, commits, reflogs, worktrees.
- `src/git/auth.rs`: network credential classification, prompting, and session cache.
- `src/helpers/`: keymaps, layout persistence, themes, recent repos, symbols, text, colors.

## Known Limitations

- No filesystem watcher. Use reload when repository state changes outside the app.
- Network operations are remote-name limited and mostly assume `origin`.
- Current branch push is force push only.
- No pull UI.
- Conflict resolution editing is external.
- Worktree move/repair and custom separate worktree branch names are not implemented.
- Submodules are ignored in commit diffs.
- Merge commit file lists and file diffs compare against the first parent only.
- The graph renderer models ordinary two-parent merges; octopus merges are not a first-class display target.
- Tag creation is lightweight only.
- No annotated-tag message flow.
- No remote tag deletion flow.
- Branch rename, remote management, and branch upstream editing are not implemented.
- Search matches loaded commit SHA prefixes only.
- Search does not match commit messages, authors, branches, tags, filenames, or unloaded history.
- Recent repositories are append-only from inside the app.
- Branch visibility is not persisted between app launches.
- Text prompts are single-line.

## Roadmap

Planned or desired features include jujutsu integration, richer worktree management, richer in-app conflict resolution, and more.
