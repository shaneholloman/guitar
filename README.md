`guita╭` is a Rust terminal UI for working with Git history from a topology-first point of view. It is built with `ratatui` and `libgit2`, and aims to make large repositories navigable without leaving the terminal.

### Demo

Here is an older recording of the v0.1.12 feature set:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oERA8MYlHjQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oERA8MYlHjQ)

The recording is still useful as a high-level tour, but the current README and in-app settings/help screen are the source of truth for current shortcuts and behavior.

### Disclaimer

This is a hobby project, and it includes sharp tools. Some actions are intentionally destructive, and several workflows still favor the happy path over a fully guided Git client experience. Use it with caution on important repositories, keep backups, and please report issues or contribute fixes if something feels wrong.

### Motivation

I wanted a terminal-based, cross-platform Git client that makes it easy to understand where I am topologically at any point in time. It needed to be fast, useful in day-to-day work, and a good reason to learn Rust. This project is where those goals met.

### Requirements

- A Rust toolchain with Cargo and Rust support.
- `user.name` and `user.email` configured in Git before launching a repository. The app reads them on repository load and uses them for commits.
- An external `ssh-agent` for network operations such as fetch, force push, tag push, and remote branch deletion.

### Install

Prebuilt binaries are published on the releases page:

[https://github.com/asinglebit/guitar/releases](https://github.com/asinglebit/guitar/releases)

To build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asinglebit/guitar.git
cd guitar
cargo build --release
```

The release binary will be at:

```bash
target/release/guitar
```

### Usage

Run `guitar` from inside a repository, from a repository subdirectory, or with an explicit path:

```bash
guitar
guitar ../path/to/your/repo
```

If the path cannot be opened as a Git repository, the app falls back to the splash screen and shows recent repositories if any are saved.

Useful flags:

```bash
guitar --version
guitar -v
guitar --reset
```

`--reset` deletes the saved `guitar` config directory so layout, keymap, and recent repository files can be regenerated.

### Current Features

#### Repository Graph

- Incremental history loading in a background walker. Large repositories become usable while history continues loading in batches.
- Graph rendering for commits, branches, merges, tags, stashes, worktree HEAD badges, and the synthetic uncommitted-work row.
- Optional abbreviated SHA column.
- Branch visibility filters, branch toggling, and one-branch solo mode.
- Optional HEAD reflog graph roots so reset-away or otherwise unlabeled HEAD positions can be found.
- Navigation by row, page, half page, list midpoint, first/last row, branch labels, and first-parent commit relationships.
- SHA-prefix jump for commits that have already been loaded.
- Recent repository splash screen.
- Status bar with current branch, detached HEAD, unborn repository state, selection counts, loading spinner, action-mode indicator, and zen-mode indicator.

#### Panes and Views

- Branch pane with local/remote and visible/hidden indicators.
- Tag pane for local tags.
- Stash pane showing stash commits alongside normal history.
- HEAD reflog pane for jumping to recent HEAD positions, including commits no branch currently names.
- Worktree pane showing main and linked worktrees, current/locked/invalid state, branch or detached HEAD, and dirty markers.
- Status panes that split staged and unstaged files on the uncommitted row, with conflicted files highlighted in yellow.
- Commit file list for the selected commit, compared with its first parent.
- Commit inspector with commit SHA, parent SHAs, featured branches, author, committer, summary, and body.
- File viewer for selected status/commit files, with line wrapping, line numbers, diff highlighting, hunk-only mode, split diff mode, and conflict-marker display.
- Settings/help view with version, commit heatmap, config paths, Git identity, auth notes, theme selection, and active keymaps.
- Zen mode for focusing one pane at a time.
- Minimal chrome mode that hides the title and status bars.

#### Git Operations

- Stage all unstaged files from the graph row, or stage one selected unstaged file from the status pane.
- Unstage all staged files from the graph row, or unstage one selected staged file from the status pane.
- Commit staged changes with an in-app commit message prompt.
- Fetch `origin` heads and tags over SSH, with pruning enabled.
- Force push the current branch to `origin` over SSH.
- Push all local tags to `origin` over SSH.
- Checkout local branches, materialize and checkout remote branches, or checkout an unlabeled commit in detached HEAD mode.
- Create a branch at the selected graph or HEAD reflog commit.
- Delete a local branch, or delete a remote branch over SSH when the selected branch is remote.
- Create and delete lightweight local tags.
- Create linked worktrees from the selected commit, using the new worktree name as the new local branch name.
- Open a selected valid worktree from the worktree pane, or press `Enter` on a graph worktree badge.
- Lock, unlock, prune, and guarded-remove linked worktrees from the pane or graph badge.
- Stash current work, including untracked files.
- Pop or drop a selected stash.
- Hard reset or mixed reset to the selected commit.
- Discard changes for a selected status file by resetting it to `HEAD`.
- Cherry-pick a selected commit after confirming or editing the resulting commit message.
- Rebase the current local branch onto the selected graph commit.
- Continue or abort an in-progress rebase or cherry-pick from action mode.
- Conflict-aware rebase and cherry-pick flows: conflicts are surfaced in a modal, marked in the graph/status/inspector panes, and can be viewed in unified or split diff mode while you resolve them externally.

#### Input, Layout, and Persistence

- Vim-like default navigation with a customizable keymap.
- Single-shot action mode for dangerous operations. Press the action-mode key first, then the action key.
- Mouse wheel scrolling over panes.
- Mouse dragging for side-pane widths, stacked-pane heights, and the split diff divider.
- Persistent layout toggles, pane widths, pane weights, and split diff divider position.
- Persistent recent repository list.
- Built-in themes include classic, ANSI, monochrome, Dracula, Monokai, Catppuccin, Atom, and VS Code, with dark and light variants for the named palettes.

Saved files live under your platform config directory in a `guitar` folder, for example `~/.config/guitar` on many Linux systems. The app currently writes:

- `keymap.json`
- `layout.json`
- `recent.json`
- `theme.json`

### Known Limitations and Missing Features

- There is no filesystem watcher. Use reload when repository state changes outside the app.
- Network operations assume the `origin` remote and SSH-agent auth. There is no remote picker, HTTPS credential prompt, or in-app credential flow.
- There is no normal non-force branch push command yet. The current branch push command is force push only.
- There is no pull UI.
- Merge workflows are not implemented.
- Conflict resolution editing is external; guitar detects conflicts, displays conflicted files, and continues rebases or cherry-picks after you resolve files in another editor.
- Rebasing requires a checked-out local branch. Detached `HEAD` rebases are intentionally refused.
- Worktree move/repair and custom separate worktree branch names are not implemented.
- Submodules are ignored in commit diffs.
- Merge commit file lists and file diffs are compared to the first parent only.
- The graph renderer models ordinary two-parent merges; octopus merges are not a first-class display target.
- Tags are lightweight only. There is no annotated-tag message flow and no remote tag deletion flow.
- Branch rename, remote management, and branch upstream editing are not implemented.
- Search only matches loaded commit SHA prefixes. It does not search commit messages, authors, branches, tags, filenames, or unloaded history.
- The keymap is customizable by editing `keymap.json`, but there is no in-app keymap editor.
- The recent repository list is append-only from inside the app; there is no in-app remove/reorder UI.

### Roadmap

Planned or desired features include jujutsu integration, richer worktree management, merging, richer in-app conflict resolution, and more.

### Default Keyboard Mappings

You will probably want to tune the keymap for your terminal and OS, especially on macOS where Option/Command behavior varies by terminal. Defaults are written to `keymap.json` on first run.

Dangerous actions live behind action mode. By default, press `Ctrl+a`, then press the action key. Action mode is single-shot, so each dangerous command needs a fresh prefix.
