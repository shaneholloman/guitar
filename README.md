### Demo

Heres a recording of me going through the features of v0.1.12
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oERA8MYlHjQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oERA8MYlHjQ)

### Disclaimer

I work on `guita╭` in my spare time, and give priority to the features I need in my day-to-day life. Use it with caution, and feel free to report issues or even better - contribute improvements! Im a lazy dude, and since this is a hobby project I just put unwrap() everywhere, such is life.

### Motivation

I needed a git client that would make it easy for me to understand where I am topologically at any given point in time. I also wanted it to be terminal based and cross-platform. I needed it to be fast. I also wanted to learn rust. So this is the project i picked to meet all of these goals at the same time.

### Features

- **Beautiful graph rendering** – Visualize commit history clearly.  
- **Reloading** – Reload the client manually using the shortcut when needed. Doesn't watch the directory.  
- **Immediate jumps** – Move through history without waiting.  
- **Pure TUI experience** – Ratatui based rendering.
- **Auth** – Currently simply attaches to the running ssh agent.  
- **Built-in diff viewer** – Inspect changes without leaving the terminal, however its very rudimentary.  
- **Tag management** – Create, view or remove tags.  
- **Stash management** – Create, view or remove stashes.  
- **Cherrypicking** – Happy path only for now.  
- **Opinionated** – Fetches prune branches and pull tags. Pushes are always hard and push local tags.
- **Keymap** – Keymap is completely customizable and is serilazied into `~/.config/guitar` folder (depending on your OS).
- **Heatmap** – Render a github-style heatmap of the repository.
- **Layout** – Somewhat primitive, also serilazied into `~/.config/guitar` folder (depending on your OS).
- **Terminal-friendly colors** – Easy on the eyes for long coding sessions with three builtin themes. 

### Planned features

- **Rebasing** – Ability to rebase.  
- **Merge** – Ability to merge.  
- **Conflicts** – Issue an alert with conflicting files to resolve externally.  

### Maybe I get to it someday features

- **Auth** – Comprehensive auth management.
- **Keymaps** – In-app keymap configuration.
- **Themes** – Custom themes.
- **Recent repos** – List of most recent repositories.

### Default keyboard mappings (they suck for now)

### Releases

Please check the releases for the latest versions: https://github.com/asinglebit/guitar/releases

### Build yourself

Clone the repo and build with Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asinglebit/guitar.git
cd guitar
cargo build --release
```

Your binary path after a successfull build:

```bash
guitar/target/release/guitar
```

Copy it wherever you want and run with a path to repo you wish to inspect

```bash
guitar ../path/to/your/repo
```

Or alternatively, alias the executable and then call it from a repo folder directly.

Running it from a non repo folder will crash the process. I will fix it sometime later...
